#### Unchained Search Plugin

The plugins are simply json files editable with a text editor. To create a new one take inspiration from the others and read the `template.json5` file.


##### Installation

Download the `.unchained` file to your phone, open it using your file manager (personal favourite: [X-plore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lonelycatgames.Xplore)) and choose Unchained as destination. If the plugin does not show up try and restart the app.
