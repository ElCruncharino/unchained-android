# Drone.io Branch

This was a branch to test a self-hosted instance of [drone.io.](https://www.drone.io/)

The problem is that running a CI/CD instance is kind of heavy for my personal server.

Check the .drone.yml file to get some useful info on how to build an Android app with drone.io.

The caching of gradle files is not working, but the rest is (steps run-tests and build).
