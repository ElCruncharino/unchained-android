### What is Real Debrid :question:

Real Debrid is a service to download files from hosting websites and the torrent network. Files are downloaded directly on their servers that you can then use for your downloads. 
They provide high speeds without premium accounts for a lot of services like Mega and RapidGator and can also convert downloads of media files into streams. It is a (cheap) paid service.
